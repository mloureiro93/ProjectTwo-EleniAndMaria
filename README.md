Ironhack WebDev 2nd Project

This project was inspired by our love for travelling and the knowledge that often deciding where to go and planning activities can be overwelming.

This app will allow the user be randomly attributed a destination as well as tailored 2 day activity plan for the most relaxing, fun and carefree getaway possible.

You can check the app here:

We hope you enjoy your trip!
